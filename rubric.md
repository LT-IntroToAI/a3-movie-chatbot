## Grading Notes
You'll be graded on your **function implementations**, **search functionality**, and **creative additions**. I'm looking for:
- Correct implementation of all action functions with proper data filtering
- Working search_pa_list that handles matches, no answers, and unknown queries
- Thoughtful additions to the movie database and pattern/action pairs
- Clean, well-documented code with appropriate docstrings
Remember: This assignment completes our movie chatbot system - focus on understanding **how databases work with natural language** and **how to extend systems with new functionality**.
